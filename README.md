# GB_BarGraph_Sample
This is a sample code to test the function of a 28 segment bargraph which is frequently found in ghostbuster props, specifically the wand.
You are going to need a 30mm - 28 Segment barGraph with 11 pinouts (7 x 4), these can be found on Ebay and are sourced from BarMeter.com, you can find the datasheet online for reference.
I used an Adafruit Adafruit 16x8 LED Matrix Driver Backpack - HT16K33 Breakout Board but any "HT16K33 Breakout" boards will work here.
