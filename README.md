# GB_BarGraph_Sample
This is a sample code to test the function of a 28 segment bargraph which is frequently found in ghostbuster props, specifically the wand.   This is only a sample code and you will need to write your routines to get it working for your Arduino projects. 

Requirements:  
You are going to need a 30mm - 28 Segment barGraph with 11 pinouts (7 x 4), these can be found on Ebay and are sourced from BarMeter.com, you can find the datasheet online for reference.  
I used an Adafruit Adafruit 16x8 LED Matrix Driver Backpack - HT16K33 Breakout Board but any "HT16K33 Breakout" boards will work here.  
You will also need to include the HT16K33 library  
  
Cheers!
